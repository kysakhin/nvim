since you dont know how to do so heres how to install new language servers

add your language server in the 
./lua/configs/lspconfig.lua 
servers table

https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md

check the global installation of that language server from that particular gh page aswell
might aswell ask gpt so it suggests the best language server
